TODO
====

HIGH
----
- npm link does not work on windows so hard coding rootLibDir which means that
  the lib may now work when installed in npm install.
- ncstyle cannot be run in the lib directory as it does not ignore the 
  node directory and the -e flag is being ignored.

MED
---

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

- The compiled file does not run.  Not too critical as on the server start up
time is less of a priority.


LOW
---

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
